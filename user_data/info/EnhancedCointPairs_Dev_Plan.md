### What This Project Is
We are implementing an enhanced cointegration pairs trading strategy on crypto futures. The core idea: identify pairs of crypto assets whose price ratio is cointegrated (mean-reverting), then trade deviations from equilibrium — go long the underperformer and short the outperformer when the spread widens beyond a z-score threshold, exit when it reverts. This is the same strategy class as our archived Candidate F (CointPairs), but enhanced with two innovations from recent peer-reviewed literature: (1) an **adaptive trailing stop-loss** calibrated to the spread's rolling volatility, and (2) a **volatility filter** that suppresses entries during high-vol regimes. These directly address the two failure modes that killed F.

This is Candidate L in our Research Log. A co-developer project running in parallel with Candidate J (Ensemble Donchian Trend-Following).

### Current Phase
- **Phase:** 1 — Dual-leg Freqtrade implementation (focused on best Phase 0 pair first)
- **Phase 0 completed:** 1h matrix → MARGINAL only; **4h fallback** → multiple **GO** rows (see `user_data/results/cointpairs_phase0_summary.csv`). **Primary Phase 1 pair:** BTC/ETH @ **4h**.
- **Phase 1 implementation:** `user_data/strategies/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01.py` + `config/config_cointpairs_l_phase1.json`. **V01 and V02** both read `config["cointpairs"].traded` / `.anchor` (defaults BTC/ETH). **β-weighted stakes** (mandatory for dollar hedge). Palazzi **vol filter** + **spread trailing** implemented as **`ENABLE_VOL_FILTER` / `ENABLE_SPREAD_TRAIL`** (default **False**) — lab backtests showed they **compressed** net P&L vs **z-reversion + time stop** alone on this pair/TF; enable for live risk experiments.
- **Backtest recap (single place to compare all runs):** `user_data/results/cointpairs_comparison_tables.md` — markdown tables aggregating V01 default, V02 default, V01 hyperopt (calendar windows), plus the β-churn sweep vs V01/V02 on 2024 and 2025–26 Q1. Source CSVs: `cointpairs_walk_forward.csv`, `cointpairs_walk_forward_v02.csv`, `cointpairs_walk_forward_v01_default_vs_hyperopt.csv`, `cointpairs_beta_churn_sweep.csv`.
- **Walk-forward (defaults, no sidecar JSON):** `python user_data/scripts/cointpairs_walk_forward.py` (Docker). **V01** baseline CSV: `user_data/results/cointpairs_walk_forward.csv`.
- **V02 (`EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V02`) — β-churn entry filter:** Skips entries when rolling mean `|Δβ|` over `beta_churn_window` exceeds `beta_churn_max` (defaults **12** bars / **0.0085**). Both are **`space="buy"`** hyperopt parameters. Tracked default sidecar: `user_data/strategy_params/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V02_defaults.json`. Full-sample defaults **beat V01** on total return (**~+27.7%** vs **~+25.7%**) and flip **2023** from slightly negative to **~+3.6%**; **2022** is worse than V01 (**~−0.5%** vs **~+8.4%**) — explicit trade-off. CSV: `user_data/results/cointpairs_walk_forward_v02.csv`.
- **β-churn grid (soften 2022 vs keep 2023/2024):** `python user_data/scripts/cointpairs_beta_churn_sweep.py` — sweeps `beta_churn_max` (and optionally `beta_churn_window` with `--sweep-window`) → `user_data/results/cointpairs_beta_churn_sweep.csv`. Example: `--quick` (2024 + 2025–26 only) or full calendar windows.
- **BTC/PAXG (gold proxy, lab):** `config/config_cointpairs_l_phase1_btc_paxg.json` — `traded` **BTC/USDT:USDT**, `anchor` **PAXG/USDT:USDT** (Binance USDT-M perp; listing ~Mar 2025 — **no** meaningful 4h history before that). Use timerange **`20250301–20260331`** (or later OOS) for backtests; full-sample walk-forward windows that start in 2022–2024 are **not** comparable for this pair. Summary metrics: `user_data/results/cointpairs_btc_paxg_backtest_summary.txt`. **Deploy / droplets:** lab-only until results justify a fourth process — see Deep Dive Part 3.
- **Lever sweep (entry/exit/z/ols/churn, V01, V02@1h, extra GO pairs):** `python user_data/scripts/cointpairs_lever_sweep.py` → `user_data/results/cointpairs_lever_sweep.csv`. `--quick` uses 2024 only (fast); default timerange `20220101–20260331`. **Config** `cointpairs.traded` / `cointpairs.anchor` + whitelist drive pair selection (see `config_cointpairs_l_phase1.json`). **Interpret multi-pair rows with care** — some pairs show extreme full-sample P&L vs one-year slice; validate before forward tests.
- **BNB/SOL deep-dive bundle (preserved):** `user_data/results/cointpairs_bnb_sol_4h_analysis/` — params + config snapshots, `SUMMARY.txt`, Freqtrade `backtest-result-*.zip` (trades export), `RUN_MANIFEST.md` for reproduction. Use for detailed analysis; do not rely on a stray `EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V02.json` in `strategies/` (removed after snapshot; restore from `strategy_params_snapshot.json` if needed).
- **Hyperopt V02 (do not pass `--cache` to hyperopt):** `docker compose run --rm freqtrade hyperopt --config /freqtrade/config/config_cointpairs_l_phase1.json --strategy EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V02 --hyperopt-loss SharpeHyperOptLoss --spaces buy sell --epochs 50 --timerange 20220101-20241231 --min-trades 15`
- **V01 default vs hyperopt (same script, `--compare --params-json user_data/strategy_params/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01_hyperopt_2026-03-31.json`):** CSV `user_data/results/cointpairs_walk_forward_v01_default_vs_hyperopt.csv`. **Hyperopt params are not robust on the full timerange** (full sample **~−4.3%** vs default **~+25.7%**); use sidecar JSON only with **window-matched** validation, not as global defaults.
- **Next immediate step:** Dry-run `trade` on VPS (see command below); optional multi-pair expansion; longer hyperopt only after walk-forward review.
- **Hyperopt (2026-03-31):** In-sample `20220101–20241231`, 40 epochs, `buy`+`sell` spaces, `SharpeHyperOptLoss`, `--min-trades 20`. Best epoch (train only): `entry_zscore` 2.89, `ols_window` 133, `zscore_window` 45, `exit_zscore` 0.04, `max_hold_candles` 318 — saved as `user_data/hyperopt_results/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01_best_params_2026-03-31.json`. **Do not** leave a same-named `.json` next to the strategy unless you intend to load it: copy that file to `user_data/strategies/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01.json` to apply, or delete that file to use `DecimalParameter` defaults in code.
- **OOS sanity (20250101–20260331, with best JSON applied):** ~+4.5% total, PF ~1.11, 30 trades — positive but far below in-sample; treat hyperopt as exploratory until walk-forward confirms.
- **Blocking issues:** None

**Dry-run (one-off container, overrides compose `command`):**

`docker compose run --rm freqtrade trade --config /freqtrade/config/config_cointpairs_l_phase1.json --strategy EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01 --db-url sqlite:////freqtrade/user_data/tradesv3.cointpairs_l.dryrun.sqlite --logfile /freqtrade/user_data/logs/freqtrade_cointpairs_l.log --userdir /freqtrade/user_data`

(Ensure `dry_run: true` and API keys as required by your exchange tier; use a dedicated SQLite DB so it does not overwrite other bots.)

### Key Context from Research Log
- We are Co-Investigators, Co-Strategists, and Co-Developers. Claude pushes back on bad ideas. See Research Log Section 1.
- Our objective is high-ROI, high-frequency crypto trading. See Research Log Section 2.
- **CointPairs (Candidate F) was ARCHIVED** after Phase 1 FAIL. Two independent failure modes: (1) single-leg directional exposure — without hedging the second leg, persistent directional moves bleed the strategy; (2) trade frequency — 0.05 trades/day on the only GO pair (BNB/ETH@4h). See Research Log Section 4.1.
- **What worked in F:** The mean-reverting structure is real (Hurst H ≈ 0.25). Phase 0 fee sweep showed solid economics when stoploss is absent (168bps@ez=3.0). Rolling β was stable. The Phase 0 validation framework is directly reusable.
- **LiqCascade is ACTIVE** in Phase 3 dry-run. Candidate J (Ensemble Donchian) is being built in parallel by the primary developer. L is a diversifying strategy — mean-reversion vs trend-following vs event-driven.
- **Critical lessons that apply here:** Mean-reversion half-life must be compatible with trading frequency (#9). Bull-market validation bias — check long vs short P&L symmetry (#10). Fee economics sweep before infrastructure (#7). Single-leg directional exposure is fatal (#F post-mortem).
- **Reusable infrastructure:** `user_data/scripts/cointpairs_phase0_validation.py` (v4) — complete pipeline (ADF → EG → Johansen → Hurst → OU half-life → rolling β stability → fee sweep with time-stop rate check). `CointPairsStrategy_V02.py` and `config_cointpairs_V02.json` — single-leg strategy code (reference only; L requires dual-leg rewrite).

### How L Differs from Archived F
| Aspect | F (Archived) | L (This Project) |
|---|---|---|
| **Legs** | Single-leg (long underperformer only) | **Dual-leg** (long underperformer + short outperformer) |
| **Stoploss** | Fixed percentage (-8% to -25%) — all calibrations failed | **Adaptive trailing stop** calibrated to spread's rolling volatility (Palazzi 2025) |
| **Entry filter** | None beyond z-score threshold | **Volatility filter** — suppress entries during high-vol regimes (Palazzi 2025) |
| **Pair universe** | BNB/ETH only (sole Phase 0 GO at 4h) | **10 major cryptos, all 45 unique pairs** screened at 1h (Palazzi design) |
| **Timeframe** | 4h | **1h** (targeting higher frequency; IEEE data suggests even shorter may work) |
| **Lookback optimization** | Fixed | **Grid-search optimized** lookback period per pair (Palazzi 2025) |
| **Validation** | In-sample only | **Walk-forward** (75/25 split, rolling) |

## Part 1: Strategy Summary

### 1.1 What Enhanced Cointegration Pairs Trading Is
At each candle:
1. For each active cointegrated pair (A, B), compute the **spread**: `S_t = log(price_A) - β × log(price_B)`, where β is the cointegrating vector (hedge ratio)
2. Compute the **z-score** of the spread: `z_t = (S_t - mean(S)) / std(S)` over a rolling lookback window
3. **Enter** when `|z_t|` exceeds entry threshold (e.g., ±2.0):
   - If `z_t > +threshold`: spread is too wide → short A, long B (expect reversion)
   - If `z_t < -threshold`: spread is too narrow → long A, short B
4. **Exit** when spread reverts to zero (z-score crosses back toward 0), OR via adaptive trailing stop, OR via time stop (backup)
5. **Volatility filter:** Suppress entry if the spread's recent rolling volatility exceeds a percentile threshold (e.g., top 10% of historical vol) — high-vol regimes produce false z-score signals
6. **Adaptive trailing stop:** Track the extreme spread value since entry; close position if spread reverses by more than `k × rolling_vol_spread` from the extreme — adapts to current market conditions

The alpha comes from equilibrium reversion: two assets sharing a common stochastic trend (e.g., BTC and ETH both driven by crypto market sentiment) temporarily diverge, then market forces (arbitrageurs, correlated flows, shared fundamentals) pull them back together.

### 1.2 Key Academic Findings
- **Palazzi (J. Futures Markets, Aug 2025, peer-reviewed):** Enhanced pairs trading on 10 major cryptos with adaptive trailing stop + vol filter. Consistently outperforms conventional pairs trading and passive approaches. Positive performance across both bull and bear regimes. Walk-forward validated.
- **Tadi & Witzany (Financial Innovation, 2025):** Copula-based pairs trading on Binance USDT-margined futures. Outperforms standard cointegration and copula approaches. Weekly pair re-selection using BTC as reference asset. Tested on our exact venue.
- **IEEE Xplore (2020):** Pairs trading on 26 cryptos at 5-min, 1h, and daily frequencies on Binance. Daily distance method returns −0.07%/month; **5-min returns 11.61%/month**. Higher frequency dramatically improves performance. Intraday mean-reverting behavior exists but is absent in daily data.
- **Our own F post-mortem:** Signal is real (Hurst H ≈ 0.25), fee economics are viable at 4h with no stoploss. Failure was structural (single-leg, frequency), not signal quality.

### 1.3 Why This Candidate Is Different from Our Failures
| Previous Failure | Why L Avoids It |
|---|---|
| F: single-leg directional exposure | **Dual-leg** — long underperformer + short outperformer simultaneously. Market-neutral by construction. |
| F: 0.05 trades/day frequency | **10 cryptos = 45 pairs** screened (vs F's 1 pair). **1h timeframe** (vs F's 4h). IEEE data shows frequency improves returns. |
| F: fixed stoploss all calibrations failed | **Adaptive trailing stop** calibrated to spread's rolling volatility — not a fixed percentage. Adjusts to current market conditions. |
| F: no entry filter | **Volatility filter** suppresses entries during high-vol regimes (false z-score signals). |
| RAME: edge too small | Spread mean-reversion moves are typically 50–300+ bps at 1h — well above fee floor. F's Phase 0 showed 168bps@ez=3.0 at 4h. |
| G: regime instability | Market-neutral pairs are structurally regime-agnostic — the spread doesn't care whether both assets are going up or down, only whether their ratio is reverting. Palazzi confirms positive performance in both bull and bear. |

### 1.4 The Dual-Leg Coordination Challenge
This is the primary engineering challenge (F's criterion 3 conditional pass). Freqtrade treats every trade as independent — it has no native concept of "paired legs." We need to ensure:

1. **Simultaneous entry:** When z-score crosses the threshold, both the long leg and the short leg must open together. If one leg fails to fill, the other must be cancelled or immediately closed.
2. **Simultaneous exit:** When the spread reverts (or trailing stop fires), both legs must close together. A half-closed pair is a naked directional position — exactly what killed F.
3. **Paired P&L tracking:** The strategy must track combined P&L across both legs, not per-leg P&L.

**Architecture approach:**
- Use `bot_loop_start()` to compute spreads and z-scores across all pairs
- Store pair state (paired_trade_id, entry_z, entry_time, extreme_spread) in `custom_info`
- `confirm_trade_entry()`: only confirm if the other leg can also be entered (check available margin, open trade count)
- `custom_exit()`: when one leg triggers exit, also exit the paired leg by setting its exit signal
- `max_open_trades`: set to 2× the number of desired concurrent pairs (e.g., 2×5 = 10 for 5 simultaneous pairs)
- **Fallback safety:** If only one leg is open for > 2 candles without the other, force-close it and log the error

### 2.1 Key Design Decisions

**Asset universe:** 10 major cryptos selected per Palazzi's design — 5 PoW + 5 PoS by market cap. Suggested starting set (verify current market caps):
- PoW: BTC, DOGE, LTC, BCH, ETC
- PoS: ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, XRP

This yields **45 unique pairs** for cointegration screening. Not all will be cointegrated — expect 10–15 to pass ADF/Johansen tests based on Palazzi's 37/90 hit rate.

**Timeframe:** 1h candles. F used 4h; IEEE data shows higher frequency improves returns. Phase 0 must validate that OU half-life is compatible with 1h trading (Lesson #9).

**Cointegration testing:** Engle-Granger (primary) + Johansen (confirmation). Re-test monthly or on a rolling basis — cointegration can break down.

**Lookback window for z-score:** Grid-search optimized per pair in Phase 0 (per Palazzi). Start range: 48h–720h (2 days to 30 days).

**Volatility filter:** Suppress entry when the spread's rolling volatility (e.g., 24h trailing std) exceeds the 90th percentile of its historical distribution. This prevents entering during regime breaks where cointegration is temporarily stressed.

**Adaptive trailing stop:**
- Track `extreme_spread`: the minimum spread value (for long-spread trades) or maximum (for short-spread trades) since entry
- Close position if spread reverses by `k × rolling_vol_spread` from the extreme
- `k` is a hyperparameter — Palazzi uses volatility-adaptive calibration
- This replaces F's fixed -8% to -25% stoploss that failed at every calibration

**Position sizing:**
- Each pair trade uses two legs with equal notional exposure
- `max_open_trades`: 2 × N_concurrent_pairs (e.g., 10 for 5 simultaneous pair trades)
- Per-leg stake: total_stake / (2 × N_concurrent_pairs)
- Leverage: 2x initially per leg
- `tradable_balance_ratio`: 0.90 (lower than J's 0.95 because dual-leg ties up more margin)

## Part 3: Phase Plan

### Phase 0: Pair Discovery + Frequency Validation (Days 1–2)

**Goal:** Identify which pairs are cointegrated at 1h, validate that OU half-lives are compatible with hourly trading, and run fee-inclusive signal validation. **Reuse `cointpairs_phase0_validation.py` (v4)** — adapt, don't rebuild.

**Tasks (Day 1 — Pair Discovery):**
1. Download 1h OHLCV for the 10-asset universe, 2022–2026
   ```
   freqtrade download-data --config config/config_cointpairs_v2.json --timerange 20220101-20260331 --timeframe 1h
   ```
2. Run cointegration screening across all 45 pairs using the existing Phase 0 pipeline:
   - ADF test on each asset (confirm non-stationarity of levels)
   - Engle-Granger cointegration test on each pair (p < 0.05)
   - Johansen test for confirmation
   - For each cointegrated pair: compute Hurst exponent, OU half-life, rolling β stability
3. **Critical check (Lesson #9):** For each cointegrated pair, compare OU half-life to the intended hold horizon. If half-life > 168h (7 days) at 1h, the pair may be too slow for our frequency objective. **Do not discard** — log it and flag for 4h testing. But prioritize pairs with half-life < 72h (3 days).
4. Output: cointegration matrix (45 pairs × pass/fail), ranked by OU half-life (fastest reversion first), with Hurst H and rolling β stability for each.

**Tasks (Day 2 — Fee-Inclusive Signal Validation):**
5. For each cointegrated pair, run a sweep on the existing Phase 0 fee-sweep tool (adapted for 1h):
   - Z-score entry thresholds: 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0
   - Lookback windows: 48h, 96h, 168h, 336h, 720h
   - Exit: z-score reversion to 0 (no stoploss — match F's Phase 0 approach that correctly identified the signal)
   - Fee: 10 bps per side × 2 legs = **20 bps round-trip total** (both legs!)
   - Track: per-trade P&L, profit factor, trade count, time-stop rate, avg hold duration
   - **Lesson #10 check:** For each pair, verify that long-spread and short-spread entries produce comparable P&L. If one side is +200bps and the other is -300bps, the signal is the market direction, not mean reversion.
6. Regime-split results: 2022 (bear), 2023 (range), 2024–2025 (bull), 2026 (recent)
7. **Fee note: dual-leg doubles the fee cost.** F's Phase 0 used 10 bps round-trip (single leg). L uses 20 bps round-trip (both legs). The spread move must be > 20 bps per trade for profitability. Check this explicitly.
8. Output: pair ranking by profitability, regime stability matrix, fee-sensitivity analysis.

**Go/No-Go for Phase 1:**
- At least **3 cointegrated pairs** with OU half-life < 72h at 1h resolution
- At least **1 pair** showing profit factor > 1.3 after 20 bps dual-leg fees in the sweep
- **Long-spread and short-spread P&L are roughly symmetric** (within 30% of each other) — confirming the signal is mean-reversion, not directional bias (Lesson #10)
- Time-stop rate < 50% (if using a time stop as backup) — confirms reversion is happening within the hold window (Lesson #9)
- Trade frequency across all GO pairs combined > 0.5 trades/day

**If no pairs pass at 1h:** Test 4h as fallback (same pipeline, just change timeframe). If 4h also fails, the OU half-lives may be fundamentally incompatible with active trading — this is the same failure mode as F, and we STOP.

**If pairs pass but dual-leg fee cost wipes out edge:** The 20 bps dual-leg cost is the structural challenge. If mean spread moves are 25–40 bps, the margin is razor-thin. Consider: (a) maker execution on one leg to reduce fees, (b) wider z-score thresholds to capture larger spread moves, (c) fewer but higher-quality pairs. If no workaround exists, STOP — Lesson #7 applies.

### Phase 1: Dual-Leg Freqtrade Implementation (Days 3–5)

**Prerequisite:** Phase 0 GO — at least 3 cointegrated pairs with viable economics.

**This is the engineering-heavy phase.** The dual-leg coordination logic is the primary implementation challenge — allocate an extra day vs J's timeline.

**Tasks:**
1. Create `config/config_cointpairs_v2.json`: all 10 assets in StaticPairList, futures mode, 1h, fees 0.05%/side, leverage 2x, `max_open_trades` = 2 × N_concurrent_pairs
2. Create `user_data/strategies/EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01.py`:
   - `informative_pairs()`: all 10 assets at 1h
   - `bot_loop_start()`: load all pair data, compute spreads + z-scores + rolling vol for all cointegrated pairs, store in `self.custom_info`
   - `populate_entry_trend()`: for each asset, check if it's the "entry leg" of any pair where z-score crossed the threshold and vol filter passes. Set `enter_long` or `enter_short` accordingly.
   - `confirm_trade_entry()`: **critical** — verify the paired leg can also be opened (margin available, not already in a conflicting trade). If not, reject the entry.
   - `custom_exit()`: check (a) z-score reversion to exit band, (b) adaptive trailing stop, (c) time stop, (d) orphan leg detection. When triggered, close both legs.
   - `custom_stake_amount()`: equal notional per leg, total per pair = 1/N_concurrent_pairs of available capital
3. **Build and test the dual-leg coordination** incrementally:
   - Step 1: Get paired entries working (both legs open on same candle)
   - Step 2: Get paired exits working (both legs close together)
   - Step 3: Add orphan detection (if one leg is open without partner for > 2 candles, force close)
   - Step 4: Add the adaptive trailing stop
   - Step 5: Add the volatility filter
4. Backtest on 2022–2026 using Phase 0's top 3–5 pairs and best parameters
5. **Diagnostic checks:**
   - Are both legs opening simultaneously? Check trade logs for timing mismatches.
   - Orphan rate: how often does only one leg open/close? Should be 0% ideally, < 5% acceptable.
   - Combined pair P&L: does the strategy actually capture spread reversion, or is one leg dominating?
   - Adaptive trailing stop fire rate: should be < 20% (it's a safety net for cointegration breakdown, not the primary exit)
   - Per-pair performance: which pairs contribute most? Any pair consistently losing?

**Go/No-Go for Phase 2:**
- Profit factor > 1.2 on full backtest
- Orphan leg rate < 5%
- Profitable in at least 2 of 3 regime periods (bear, range, bull)
- **Long-spread and short-spread trades have comparable P&L** (the market-neutral check)
- Trade frequency across all pairs > 0.5 trades/day
- Drawdown < 25% (at 2x leverage per leg)

### Phase 2: Optimization + OOS Validation (Days 6–7)

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 GO.

**Tasks:**
1. **Lookback window optimization:** Grid-search per pair (Palazzi's approach): optimize the z-score lookback window to maximize in-sample Sharpe on 2022–2024
2. **Pair re-selection:** Re-run cointegration tests on rolling 6-month windows. Which pairs maintain cointegration throughout? Drop unstable pairs.
3. Hyperopt on 2022–2024:
   - Parameters: z-score entry threshold, z-score exit band, lookback window, vol filter percentile, trailing stop k-factor, time stop duration
4. Out-of-sample validation on 2025–2026
5. Walk-forward: train on rolling 6-month windows, test on 2-month windows, roll forward

**Go/No-Go for Phase 3:**
- OOS profit factor > 1.2
- Walk-forward profitable in at least 5 of 8 windows
- Cointegration stable in at least 3 pairs across the full sample
- Parameters not at extreme edges

---

### Phase 3: Dry-Run Deployment (Week 2+)

**Goal:** Forward-test Candidate L on Binance USDT-M with the **deploy-only** repo (see **Part 6**). Validate dual-leg coordination in live market conditions (not just backtest). LiqCascade / Candidate J may run elsewhere; L’s production layout is **not** a shared single-droplet compose profile.

**Implemented layout:**
- Repository **`freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`** (`https://github.com/whitneyjohn61/freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`): **`docker compose --profile v01`** on one droplet, **`--profile v02`** on a second droplet; six containers (three spreads × V01 vs V02). Details: Part 6 and `deploy/README.md` in that repo.

**Tasks:**
1. Provision droplets, firewall (SSH + UI ports per profile), clone deploy repo, generate config secrets — see **`deploy/README.md`**.
2. **Critical live-monitoring:** Watch for orphan legs in the first 48 hours. A coordination failure in live trading is far worse than in backtest.
3. Monitor for 2+ weeks.

**Go/No-Go for Phase 4 (live capital):**
- 2+ weeks, minimum 15 completed pair trades (both legs)
- Zero orphan legs in production
- Total return consistent with backtest expectation
- Trade frequency within 30% of backtest
- Comfortable coexistence with other strategies **only after** confirming margin, rate limits, and ops runbooks — L runs as dedicated compose profiles on the deploy droplet(s), not embedded in the lab `docker-compose.yml`

## Part 4: What Not To Repeat

| Anti-pattern | Why it's relevant here | Addressed in |
|---|---|---|
| Single-leg directional exposure (F's fatal flaw) | **Dual-leg is mandatory.** If paired coordination can't be built reliably, STOP — don't fall back to single-leg. | Core architecture, orphan detection |
| Fee sweep after infrastructure (Lesson #7) | Phase 0 sweep before any Freqtrade code. **20 bps dual-leg cost** must be survivable. | Phase 0 Day 2 |
| OU half-life incompatible with timeframe (Lesson #9) | Phase 0 explicitly computes half-life and compares to 1h hold horizon. | Phase 0 Day 1 |
| Bull-market validation bias (Lesson #10) | Long-spread vs short-spread P&L symmetry check at every gate. | All go/no-go gates |
| Fixed stoploss on mean-reversion (F's second flaw) | **Adaptive trailing stop** calibrated to spread rolling vol — not fixed %. | Exit mechanism |
| Entering during cointegration breakdown | **Volatility filter** suppresses entries when spread vol is extreme. | Entry filter |
| Assuming cointegration is permanent | Re-test on rolling windows. Drop pairs that lose cointegration. | Phase 2 pair re-selection |
| Assuming paper timeframe transfers to ours | Palazzi uses daily; we need 1h. Phase 0 explicitly validates. | Phase 0 frequency validation |

### Appendix A: Asset Universe

| # | Asset | Consensus | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | BTC/USDT:USDT | PoW | Anchor — highest liquidity |
| 2 | ETH/USDT:USDT | PoS (since Sep 2022) | Anchor — second highest liquidity |
| 3 | BNB/USDT:USDT | PoS | F's Phase 0 tested BNB/ETH — GO at 4h |
| 4 | SOL/USDT:USDT | PoS | High vol, strong recent trends |
| 5 | XRP/USDT:USDT | PoS-like (RPCA) | Regulatory-sensitive — may break cointegration during legal events |
| 6 | ADA/USDT:USDT | PoS | Lower vol, potential stable cointegration partner |
| 7 | DOGE/USDT:USDT | PoW | Meme-driven — may not cointegrate reliably |
| 8 | LTC/USDT:USDT | PoW | BTC derivative — likely strong BTC/LTC cointegration |
| 9 | BCH/USDT:USDT | PoW | BTC fork — historically cointegrated with BTC |
| 10 | ETC/USDT:USDT | PoW | ETH fork — historically cointegrated with ETH |

*This list follows Palazzi's 5 PoW + 5 PoS design. Adjust based on current Binance Futures availability and liquidity (24h volume > $10M per asset). Phase 0 will determine which of the 45 pairs are actually cointegrated.*

## Part 6: Deploy repository (`freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`)

**Purpose:** Standalone forward-test deployment for Candidate L — **EnhancedCointPairsStrategy_V01** vs **V02** on Binance USDT-M futures, without the full `freqtrade-strategy-lab` tree.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/whitneyjohn61/freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading](https://github.com/whitneyjohn61/freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading) (SSH: `git@github.com:whitneyjohn61/freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading.git`).

**Division of labor:**
| Location | Role |
|----------|------|
| **`freqtrade-strategy-lab`** | Research, data download, Phase 0 pipeline, backtests, walk-forward scripts, hyperopt, comparison tables, canonical strategy development |
| **`freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`** | Deploy-only: `Dockerfile` / `freqtradeorg/freqtrade:stable`, `docker-compose.yml`, strategy copies, config **templates**, `scripts/` (droplet setup, status, trade summaries), **`deploy/README.md`** |

**Runtime topology (DigitalOcean):**
- **Droplet A:** `docker compose --profile v01 up -d` — **V01 only**. Freqtrade UI on host ports **8080** (BTC/ETH), **8081** (BNB/SOL), **8082** (BTC/SOL).
- **Droplet B:** `docker compose --profile v02 up -d` — **V02 only**. Same three spreads on **8083**, **8084**, **8085**.

**Configs** (built from `config/templates/`; generated JSON with `jwt_secret_key` / UI password is **gitignored**):
- `config_cointpairs_l_phase1.json` — traded/anchor BTC / ETH  
- `config_cointpairs_l_phase1_bnb_sol.json` — BNB / SOL  
- `config_cointpairs_l_phase1_btc_sol.json` — BTC / SOL  

**V01** in the deploy repo matches the lab’s dual-leg logic but reads **`cointpairs`** from config (required for the three spreads). **`dry_run`** defaults true in templates; add Binance API keys before live trading.

**Where to read next:** Repo **`README.md`** (setup, `generate_api_secrets.py`, quick start). **`deploy/README.md`** — firewall (SSH + UI ports), `droplet_setup_from_local.ps1` / `droplet_setup.sh`, `droplet_status_from_local.ps1` (both droplets: docker state, logs, trades). Optional env: `FT_V01_HOST`, `FT_V02_HOST`, `FT_SSH_USER` — see `scripts/local.env.example`.

**This document:** Maintained canonically under **`freqtrade-strategy-lab`** at `user_data/info/EnhancedCointPairs_Dev_Plan.md` and **copied** into the deploy repo (same path under `user_data/info/`) so operators who only clone **`freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`** have the full Candidate L plan.

## Part 7: Reference Material

### 7.1 Key Papers
- **Palazzi (J. Futures Markets, Aug 2025):** "Trading Games: Beating Passive Strategies in the Bullish Crypto Market" — Primary source. Adaptive trailing stop, vol filter, grid-search lookback optimization, walk-forward validation. 10 cryptos, bull + bear regime performance.
- **Tadi & Witzany (Financial Innovation, 2025):** "Copula-based trading of cointegrated cryptocurrency Pairs" — Copula approach on Binance USDT-margined futures. Weekly pair re-selection. Outperforms standard methods. Our exact venue.
- **IEEE Xplore (2020):** "Pairs Trading in Cryptocurrency Markets" — 26 cryptos at 5-min, 1h, daily on Binance. Critical finding: frequency matters enormously (5-min: +11.61%/month vs daily: −0.07%/month).
- **Our CointPairs (F) post-mortem:** Research Log Section 4.1. Signal real, failure structural. Phase 0 validation framework reusable.

### 7.2 Freqtrade Implementation References
- **Simultaneous long/short:** Freqtrade supports `can_short = True` in futures mode
- **Paired coordination:** `confirm_trade_entry()` for pre-entry validation, `custom_exit()` for paired exits, `bot_loop_start()` for cross-pair state management
- **Custom trailing stop:** `custom_stoploss()` — return negative value; can reference `self.custom_info` for spread-based stop levels
- **Informative pairs:** `informative_pairs()` for loading all 10 assets

### 7.3 Relationship to F's Codebase
L reuses:
- `cointpairs_phase0_validation.py` (v4) — adapt fee calculation for dual-leg (20 bps not 10 bps)
- Cointegration testing methodology (ADF, EG, Johansen, Hurst, OU half-life)
- Spread computation and z-score logic

L replaces:
- Single-leg → dual-leg (fundamental architecture change)
- Fixed stoploss → adaptive trailing stop
- No entry filter → volatility filter
- Fixed lookback → grid-search optimized lookback
- Single-pair → multi-pair universe

### 7.4 Coordination with Candidate J
J and L are designed to be **uncorrelated and concurrent:**
- J is long-only trend-following (serial correlation). L is market-neutral mean-reversion (equilibrium reversion).
- J performs best in trending markets. L performs best in ranging markets.
- J uses 20 pairs independently. L uses 10 assets in paired combinations (lab); forward-test deploy runs the **three** spreads configured in **`freqtrade-coint-pairs-trading`**.
- They may share organizational habits (DigitalOcean, Docker) but **Candidate L production** uses the **dedicated** deploy repo and droplet layout in Part 6 — not the same compose stack as J unless you intentionally colocate on one host.
- If both validate, deploying them together can provide genuine strategy diversification when margin and ops constraints allow.
